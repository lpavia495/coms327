Assignment 1.07 CSV Parsing
Luke Pavia

Since the last assignment, I have now been able to parse all the required files into my C++ program only using C++ code. I used pyrite to access the database to get the pokedex so that I could access all the appropriate files. I then started making all the appropriate structs as requried to parse the data and have it output in the terminal. The user must enter the appropriate command argument to get the proper database file. For type_names.csv, only the English lines are outputted as required.
