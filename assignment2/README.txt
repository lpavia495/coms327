Assignment 1.02: Moving from map to map
Luke Pavia

Progressions I made from last week's assignment includes building a 2D array of maps that is 400x400,
making pokecenters and pokemarts generate depending on how far they are from the center, and making
the paths connect to each other when the user navigates through each map. I also added key commands
to move through each map and quit the program. From last time, I added two new functions which are 
loadMap and saveMap. I also made edits to createPath, placeBuilding, and main method to implement
the paths connecting, pokecenters and pokemarts having a random chance of generating, and the key
commands.
