Assignment 1.05: User Interface
Luke Pavia

Since the last assignment, I have now made this pokemon game into a turn based game. Pressing certain keys can move the playable
character into eight different directions depending on which one is pressed. Additionally, the user can now go into PokeMarts and
Pokecenters to trigger an interface. When the playable character collides with an NPC, this will trigger a battle interface
if the NPC has not been "defeated" yet. No player or NPC will be able to move on a "gate" since we will be adding more maps to 
future the assignments. Lastly I also added color to the map to make it look more creative.
