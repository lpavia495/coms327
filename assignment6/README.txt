Assignment 1.06: Moving to Neighboring Maps and Porting to C++
Luke Pavia

Since the last assignment, I have now been able to port to C++. When porting to C++ I did not make that many changes to my code.
The vast majority of it was already compatible with C++. For the most part I only had to change the include statements and parts of my code where I used malloc. When it came to moving to neighboring maps and incorporating the fly command, I did this before
I ported my code into C++. After porting my code into C++, I only made a few minor changes to fix some bugs that were in my code.
To use fly, obviosuly the user has to press 'f'. Then they can type in the coordinates. For example '5 20' would be an acceptable input.
